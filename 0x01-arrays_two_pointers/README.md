# Arrays - Two Pointers

1. [0-isPalindrome.py](0-isPalindrome.py)- [Leetcode 125](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/): A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers. Given a string ```s```, return ```true``` if it is a palindrome, or ```false``` otherwise.

2. [1-search](1-search.py) - [Leetcode 704](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/): Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return ```-1```. You must write an algorithm with ```O(log n)``` runtime complexity.

3. [2-removeDuplicates.py](2-removeDuplicates.py) - [Leetcode 26](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/): Given an integer array ```nums``` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be ```k​​​​​​​​​​​​​```​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements ```k```. The first ```k``` elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index ```k - 1``` can be ignored.
