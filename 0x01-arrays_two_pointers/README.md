# Arrays - Two Pointers
# Example
1. [0-isPalindrome.py](0-isPalindrome.py)- [Leetcode 125](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/): A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers. Given a string ```s```, return ```true``` if it is a palindrome, or ```false``` otherwise.

2. [1-search](1-search.py) - [Leetcode 704](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/): Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return ```-1```. You must write an algorithm with ```O(log n)``` runtime complexity.
