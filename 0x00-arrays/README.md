# Arrays 

1.  [217-contains_duplicate](217-contains_duplicate.py): Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct. [source](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

2. [268-missing_number](268-missing_number.py): Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array. [Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/)

3. [448-find_all_numbers_disappeared_in_an_arry](find_all_numbers_disappeared_in_an_arry.py): Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]`, return an array of all the integers in the range `[1, n] `that do not appear in `nums`.[Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/description/)

4. [1.two_sum][1.two_sum.py]: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. [Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

5. [1365-how_many_are_smaller](1365-how_many_are_smaller.py): Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].
